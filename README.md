# **Housing Price Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression**

## **Project Overview**
This project applies multiple linear regression analysis to predict housing prices based on key property attributes such as area, number of stories, and number of bedrooms. The analysis explores model assumptions, variable transformations, and model selection techniques to improve predictive accuracy.

## **Key Features**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing distributions, scatterplots, and correlations between variables.  
- **Model Development:** Building and comparing regression models to identify significant predictors.  
- **Diagnostics & Transformations:** Addressing heteroscedasticity and multicollinearity using log transformations and VIF analysis.  
- **Model Selection:** Using AIC, BIC, and partial F-tests to refine the final model.  
- **Appendix for Additional Insights:** Supporting figures and statistics to supplement the main findings.  

## **Results & Insights**
- Area of the house, number of stories, and number of bedrooms were confirmed as significant predictors.  
- Log transformation of price and area improved model assumptions.  
- The final model demonstrated improved residual behavior and predictive reliability.  

## **Technologies Used**
- Python (`pandas`, `numpy`, `statsmodels`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## **Portfolio Relevance**
This project showcases my ability to conduct statistical modeling, interpret regression diagnostics, and refine predictive models through data-driven decision-making. It demonstrates key skills in regression analysis, statistical inference, and data visualization, relevant to roles in data science, financial analytics, and sports analytics.
